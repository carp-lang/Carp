Carp is a small programming language designed to work well for interactive and performance sensitive use cases like games, sound synthesis and visualizations.

The key features of Carp are the following:
* Automatic and deterministic memory management (no garbage collector or VM)
* Inferred static types for great speed and reliability
* Live reloading of code, REPL-driven development, a fun and helpful workflow
* Ownership tracking enables a functional programming style while still using mutation of cache friendly data structures under the hood
* No hidden performance penalties – allocation and copying is explicit
* Very good integration with existing C code

## A Small OpenGL/GLFW Example

```clojure
(import gl)

(defn init []
  0f)

(defn tick [state]
  (+ state 0.15f))

(defn draw [state]
  (let [t @state
        steps 100
        step (/ 1f (itof steps))]
    (for (i 0 steps)
      (let [r (* step (itof i))
            r2 (+ r step)]
        (draw-line (* r (cosf (* t r)))
                   (* r (sinf (* t r)))
                   (* r2 (cosf (* t r2)))
                   (* r2 (sinf (* t r2))))))))

(defn spin []
  (glfw-app "Spin" init tick draw default-on-keys))
```

To build this example, save it to a file called 'example.carp' and load it with ```(load-lisp "example.carp")```, then execute ```(bake-exe spin)``` to build an executable, or ```(spin)``` to run the program directly from the REPL.
