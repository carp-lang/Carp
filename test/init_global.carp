;; This test is special because it requires it's own run.
;; It initializes a global with a something that needs to allocate memory and call functions,
;; then checks that the memory balance is correct after the init step.

(def g (copy (Array.unsafe-nth &[@"A" @"B" @"C"] 1)))

;; The one allocation left after 'carp_init_globals' should be 'g' itself:
(defn main []
  (assert (= 1l (Debug.memory-balance))))
