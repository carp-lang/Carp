The Carp Standard Library Reference can be found [online](http://carp-lang.github.io/carp-docs/core/core_index.html)
but your Carp installation should also contain a local copy in this very directory.

You can call [a short Carp program](./generate_core_docs.carp) to refresh the local copy.
Please note that the program expects to be run from the Carp installation directory not from ./docs/core:
```
carp -x ./docs/core/generate_core_docs.carp
```
