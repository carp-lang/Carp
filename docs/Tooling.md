# Atom
[language-carp](https://atom.io/packages/language-carp) offers highlight with both TextMate and Tree-sitter, where tree-sitter grammar is more powerful.

## Other editors
Clojure syntax highlighting works very well with Carp since it uses the same symbols for most things.
If you have written an editor mode, please tell us and it will be added here!
