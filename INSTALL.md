# Installation

Clone this repo, then use cmake to generate the project files that you desire. Either run it in the root of the Carp project, or from a sub directory that you create called 'build' or similar. Then build the project and make sure the resulting executable is put into the 'bin' directory (cmake should arrange that automatically). An example of how to do all of this for Xcode is in the file 'xcode.sh' in the root of the project.

```cmake .```

Add the 'bin' directory to your path to enable calling the ```carp``` command. To do this, add the following to your .bashrc / .zshrc / whatever:

```export PATH=$PATH:~/Carp/bin/```

Carp is developed on OSX 10.10 but Linux works too. More platforms are coming soon, Windows is being worked on. There are a few dependencies that have to be installed:
 * pkg-config
 * libffi
 * glfw3
 * rlwrap
 
Tip: Build libffi with ```./configure --enable-static --disable-shared``` to avoid generating a dylib that might interfere with other installations of it (like one installed with brew).

You will have to tell cmake the location of 'libffi' before it can build correctly. Try using their GUI application if you have trouble, it's pretty self explanatory (first press 'Configure', then set up the paths to 'libffi', and then press 'Generate').

To make cmake find libffi you might need to add it to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH:
```
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=../libffi/<ARCHITECTURE>/
```

And to be able to run 'make' you might need to add libffi to your C_INCLUDE_PATH:
```
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=../libffi/<ARCHITECTURE>/include
```

Replace <ARCHITECTURE> with the name of the architecture you built libffi for.

Note: 'rlwrap' is not strictly needed but makes the REPL experience much nicer, modify the '/bin/carp' script if you don't want to use it.

## Mac OS X
If 'libffi' is installed with Brew, you can find the libraries at "/usr/local/Cellar/libffi/3.0.13/lib/" and the include files at "/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/libffi-3.0.13/include".

## Linux
On Linux Clang must be installed (GCC support will be added later).

## Windows
